# mobile-first_responisve_layout
This is the second project provided by Team Treehouse. I was provided with the mobile, tablet, and desktop mockup and had to convert it into responsive html and css.

In this project I focused on using semantic html, emmet to increase productivity, and CSS skills learned from Team Treehouse, Design Course by Gary Simon and CSS in Depth by Keith J. Grant.
